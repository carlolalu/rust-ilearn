//! This library should help students of a double degree program to deal with their grades, split among different universities.
//! The idea should be that in a future this should be a library where a student can charge its grading systems and its conversion tables
//! between the grading systems, and then be able to have the correspondent translated grade. Furthermore, once this is obtained,
//! the student should be able to use also his own defined closures (callbacks actually) so to calculate the averages of such grades
//! according to the rules of each institution involved. The project is to this moment very raw.
