# Practice (ideas and similar)

## projects:

do exercises with the platform 'exercisism', it is particularly good!!!

advised by victor: build programs to operate on a text-based web-browser, as

rust projects WALKTHROUGH, very knorcke projects:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jp7sabBCp4&list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDD5vy2BuSHvFZU0a6RDmgb

very good rust projects: https://zerotomastery.io/blog/rust-practice-projects/

plot stuff with nalgebra and plotters

make simulations with rapier

codewars, telegram-bot, 

(chapter 12 of the official book is actually a very good resource on how to build incrementally a project!)

another idea could be to create a text converter to write everything in a stupid 2000s ways:
'Oh My G0D U LuK f4b0ul0u$', perfect for talpe
