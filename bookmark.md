I usually mark the topic I must start.

# official-book

actual: 7 (crates and modules)

after each chapter I should try to do some of rust-by-practice or codewars

# rust-by-practice

(notice, here I just keep track of which exercises I have done)

actual: 6 (compound types)

# oreilly

(The core of the language arrives to page 390, i.e. the end of chapter 15. The rust is more advanced stuff, that I could eventually cover in a distant future)

actual: chapter 6 (expressions)

## at the end of each git push: one small exercise of some kind

update: the plan is to follow now chapter 6 from the practice book and chapter 6 from the 'oreilly. I need an exercise at the end of each chapter.
