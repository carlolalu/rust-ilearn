I usually mark the topic I must start.

# theory:

## official-book

actual: 8 - exercises at 8.3

## oreilly

actual: 9 - end

## design patterns

done: creational (factory, singleton), behavioural (), structural ()

# Practice (ideas and similar)

## projects:
advised by victor: build programs to operate on a text-based web-browser, as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)

very good rust projects: https://zerotomastery.io/blog/rust-practice-projects/
## rust-by-practice

actual: 8

// exercise

## at the end of each git push: one small exercise of some kind

update: the plan is to follow now chapter 6 from the practice book and chapter 6 from the 'oreilly. I need an exercise at the end of each chapter.

update 10.12.2023: slices are to me absolutely not clear, I need to find a good reference to it and study them again and again, together with exercises.
