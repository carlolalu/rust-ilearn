I usually mark the topic I must start.

# theory:

## official-book

actual: 10 - end

## oreilly

actual: 9 - end

## design patterns

done: creational (factory, singleton), behavioural (), structural ()

# Practice (ideas and similar)

## projects:
advised by victor: build programs to operate on a text-based web-browser, as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m

very good rust projects: https://zerotomastery.io/blog/rust-practice-projects/

codewars, telegram-bot, 

another idea could be to create a text converter to write everything in a stupid 2000s ways:
'Oh My G0D U LuK f4b0ul0u$', perfect for talpe

## at the end of each git push: one small exercise of some kind
