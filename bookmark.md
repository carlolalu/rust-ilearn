I usually mark the topic I must start.

# official-book

actual: 7 (crates and modules)


after each chapter/commit I should try to do some of rust-by-practice or codewars

# rust-by-practice

actual: 8

// exercise

# oreilly

(The core of the language arrives to page 390, i.e. the end of chapter 15. The rust is more advanced stuff, that I could eventually cover in a different future)

actual: chapter 7

// exercise

# design patterns

done: creational (factory, singleton), behavioural (), structural ()

## at the end of each git push: one small exercise of some kind

update: the plan is to follow now chapter 6 from the practice book and chapter 6 from the 'oreilly. I need an exercise at the end of each chapter.

update 10.12.2023: slices are to me absolutely not clear, I need to find a good reference to it and study them again and again, together with exercises.
