## plan: 
ch15 official,

concurrency: ch16 official,

official advanced features (chapter 17,18,19)
official final project: chapter 20

oreilly ch19,20 (concurrency, parallelism and async)
tokio tutorials
rayon tutorials

dive deeper: read chapter 14 of official. Oreilly ch 15,18 (input and output), cover oreilly chapters left (temporarily?) behind

dive into data visualization with rapier, plotters and similar

### EXERCISES:
http://nifty.stanford.edu/
exercisism: Parallel Letter Frequency 
ch2 oreilly: do the mandelbrot set and other visualization things
treat physical models and their visualisation
other books offline


# theory:

## official-book

actual: 15.6 - end

left behind: 14

## oreilly

actual: 14 - end

left temporarily behind: 10,12,13,16,17,21-23

## design patterns

done: creational (factory, singleton), behavioural (), structural ()

# Practice (ideas and similar)

## projects:

do exercises with the platform 'exercisism', it is particularly good!!!

advised by victor: build programs to operate on a text-based web-browser, as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m

rust projects WALKTHROUGH, very knorcke projects:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jp7sabBCp4&list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDD5vy2BuSHvFZU0a6RDmgb

very good rust projects: https://zerotomastery.io/blog/rust-practice-projects/

plot stuff with nalgebra and plotters

make simulations with rapier

codewars, telegram-bot, 

(chapter 12 of the official book is actually a very good resource on how to build incrementally a project!)

another idea could be to create a text converter to write everything in a stupid 2000s ways:
'Oh My G0D U LuK f4b0ul0u$', perfect for talpe
