# rust-ilearn
A repo where I learn rust.

## Structure of the repo

The folder `waste` contains trash examples of draft code which is not worthy to be watched, but still testifies I poked it and played around with it. The other three folders contain exercises which might not be very clean, but are worthy to be saved not as 'waste'.

## Sources

- the official tokio tutorial: https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial , Channels

- the oreilly book for async rust: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/async-rust/9781098149086/     (250 pages)
- the oreilly book for rust atomics and locks: https://marabos.nl/atomics/    (250 pages)

- the official rust book: COMPLETED
- the o'reilly book: COMPLETED, only the chapters left (temporarily?) behind, i.e. (parts of:) 10,12,13,16,17,21,22,23


## plan
you MUST do projects to really learn

- tokio official website - tutorial(s)
- design patterns
- official async book with its exercises
- exercise with std::net. An idea is monitoring certain data and then plot some analysis on it. Use the other books you have.
- ex with tokio async (kurose? docs on rust? echoserver? black hat rust and other books?). In this way u get to use both tokio and some plotting library.
- more on rayon (official website/crate?)
- more on networks (kurose? docs on rust? echoserver? black hat rust? and other books?). Suggestion, the book `Network programming with Rust` and `Rust for Network Programming`

### considered resources for the future:
- the official asynchronous book: https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/01_chapter.html
- the official async_std book (which mentions the previous book): https://book.async.rs/introduction
