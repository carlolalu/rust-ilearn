# rust-ilearn
A repo where I learn rust.

## Structure of the repo

The folder `WaStE` contains trash examples of draft code which is not worthy to be watched, but still testifies I poked it and played around with it. The other three folders contain exercises which might not be very clean, but are worthy to be saved not as 'waste'.

## Sources

### the oreilly book.
It totally has the advanced level required, but maybe properly because of this it is too advanced. Chapter 2 exposes me to concepts which I have no idea about, in particular about networking and concurrency (of which I would still like to learn one day). The book has no exercises but these examples, again.

## plan
you MUST do projects to really learn

- ch 20 form oreilly,
- official async book with its exercises
- exercise with std::net. An idea is monitoring certain data and then plot some analysis on it. Use the other books you have.
- tokio official website - tutorial(s)
- design patterns
- ex with tokio async (kurose? docs on rust? echoserver? black hat rust and other books?). In this way u get to use both tokio and some plotting library.
- more on rayon (official website/crate?)
- more on networks (kurose? docs on rust? echoserver? black hat rust? and other books?). Suggestion, the book `Network programming with Rust` and `Rust for Network Programming`
