# rust-ilearn
A repo where I learn rust. 

It is for me difficult to decide which source to follow. I found 3 main sources.

1. the online official book.
It is a good guide but it is written for maybe people with too little background. This is slightly disappointing, but most of all risks to lack the comparison with other languages. For example when introducing rust references somebody would make comparison with cpp, but judging from the approach of the book, it will avoid to dive into such knowledge whcih could be scary for somebody. Besides, it lacks exercises

2. the oreilly book.
It totally has the advanced level required, but maybe properly because of this it is too advanced. Chapter 2 exposes me to concepts which I have no idea about, in particular about networking and concurrency (of which I would still like to learn one day). Besides the edition I have uses some old crates, and when I try to compile such code (I use the same versions as the book), it seems the library has some error which do not compile properly (did I make an error without realisisng it). And, additionally to this, the book has no exercises, again

3. the book `rust-by-practice` and its similar twin `rust-by-examples`. They have exercises, but they are mainly examples of code completion, rather than real exercises, thus on the long term I would not write much, nor gain satisfaction or track well my progress. (I recently found a small contraddiciton on what I said: `There are three parts in each chapter: examples, exercises and practices`)


The learning path should thus be this one: chapter of theory and right afterwards a chapter of practice by the practice book. For now I would leave the 'oreilly book a part, its difficulty kills the motivation. Let us start easy with the KISS philosophy.

- For the first chapters of the KISS I will have a snake learning path:
chapter 3 official-book, chapter 2 official-book, correspondent chapters from rust-by-practice

- successively I will need to understand if proceed parallelly chapter by chapter or subsection by sebsection for the two, if there is compatibility.

I just took a quick look at the oreilly book. I would like to try to learn a bit from it as well.
