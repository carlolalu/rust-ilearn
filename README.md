# rust-ilearn
A repo where I learn rust.

## Structure of the repo

The folder `WaStE` contains trash examples of draft code which is not worthy to be watched, but still testifies I poked it and played around with it. The other three folders contain exercises which might not be very clean, but are worthy to be saved not as 'waste'.

## Sources

### the oreilly book.
It totally has the advanced level required, but maybe properly because of this it is too advanced. Chapter 2 exposes me to concepts which I have no idea about, in particular about networking and concurrency (of which I would still like to learn one day). The book has no exercises but these examples, again.

- bookmark: 19 - End
- left (temporarily?) behind: 10,   12,13,   16,17,  21,22,23

For now I would leave the 'oreilly book a part, its difficulty kills the motivation. Let us start easy with the KISS philosophy, and dive into the 'oreilly later.

## plan
you MUST do projects to really learn

- ch 20 form oreilly,
- exercise with std::net. An idea is monitoring certain data and then plot some analysis on it. Use the other books you have.
- more on tokio (official website)
- design patterns
- ex with tokio async (kurose? docs on rust? echoserver? black hat rust and other books?). In this way u get to use both tokio and some plotting library.
- more on rayon (official website/crate?)
- more on networks (kurose? docs on rust? echoserver? black hat rust? and other books?). Suggestion, the book `Network programming with Rust` and `Rust for Network Programming`

In general my directions seems: 
1. tokio, concurrency and networks oriented programming (web scraping? penetration testing?)
2. physical concurrent modelling with visualization (rayon, plotting, csv files, data?)
3. draw fractals and work with images and gif (search a fractal and implement it)

## exercises

### sources: 
http://nifty.stanford.edu/, 
exercisism, 
ch2 oreilly, 
codewars,
rapier tutorial
online walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jp7sabBCp4&list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDD5vy2BuSHvFZU0a6RDmgb ,
walkthrough for simple project with some ai (chatgpt, hugging face)

### ideas: 
crate `image` at the section 'generating fractals' in the README.md
telegram-bot,
visualization things, 
physical models, 
advised by victor: build programs to operate on a text-based web-browser, as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m ,
plotting stuff with nalgebra and plotters
