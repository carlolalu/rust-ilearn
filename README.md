# rust-ilearn
A repo where I learn rust.

## Structure of the repo

The folder `WaStE` contains trash examples of draft code which is not worthy to be watched, but still testifies I poked it and played around with it. The other three folders contain exercises which might not be very clean, but are worthy to be saved not as 'waste'.

## Sources
I have now 2 main sources.

1. the online official book.
It is a good guide but it is written for maybe people with too little background. This is slightly disappointing, but most of all risks to lack the comparison with other languages. For example when introducing rust references somebody would make comparison with cpp, but judging from the approach of the book, it will avoid to dive into such knowledge which could be scary for somebody. Besides, it lacks exercises.

- left behind: 14

2. the oreilly book.
It totally has the advanced level required, but maybe properly because of this it is too advanced. Chapter 2 exposes me to concepts which I have no idea about, in particular about networking and concurrency (of which I would still like to learn one day). The book has no exercises but these examples, again.

- left (temporarily?) behind: 10,   12,13,   16,17, 18(input ed output),   21,22,23


For now I would leave the 'oreilly book a part, its difficulty kills the motivation. Let us start easy with the KISS philosophy, and dive into the 'oreilly later.

## plan

ch 20 of official,
ch 19 oreilly,
some SIMPLE physical model with rayon!!! (calculation of physics exercise? plotting?)

ch 20 form oreilly,

exercises of chapter 2 of oreilly,
exercise with std::net and tokio async (kurose? docs on rust? echoserver? black hat rust?)

more on tokio (official website)?

chapter 18 of oreilly and more on networks (kurose? docs on rust? echoserver? black hat rust?)

In general my directions seems: 
1. tokio, concurrency and networks oriented programming (web scraping? penetration testing?)
2. physical concurrent modelling with visualization (rayon, plotting, csv files, data?)


## exercises

### sources: 
http://nifty.stanford.edu/, 
exercisism, 
ch2 oreilly, 
codewars,
rapier tutorial
online walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jp7sabBCp4&list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDD5vy2BuSHvFZU0a6RDmgb ,
walkthrough for simple project with some ai (chatgpt, hugging face)

### ideas: 
telegram-bot,
visualization things, 
physical models, 
advised by victor: build programs to operate on a text-based web-browser, as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m ,
plotting stuff with nalgebra and plotters

## future topics and plans:

ch15 official,

concurrency: ch16 official,

official advanced features (chapter 17,18,19)
official final project: chapter 20

oreilly ch19,20 (concurrency, parallelism and async)
tokio tutorials
rayon tutorials

dive deeper: read chapter 14 of official. Oreilly ch 15,18 (input and output), cover oreilly chapters left (temporarily?) behind

deign patterns!!
